# Maya's Builder Tools

This mod is a collection of builder tools I made! 

_There is currently only one feature, but many more will come later on_

## Force Glazed Terracotta Orientation

This allows you to place glazed terracotta in pre-selected orientation, independently of your rotation. You can open the orientation menu by pressing **Left CTRL** while **Holding any Glazed Terracotta** in your hand. You can change the selected orientation by using scroll wheel while the menu is open.
