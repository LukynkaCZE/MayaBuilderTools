# Maya's Builder Tools

This mod is a collection of builder tools I made! 

_There is currently only one feature, but many more will come later on_

## Custom Orientation Picker

This allows you to place directional blocks in pre-selected orientation, independently of your rotation. You can open the orientation menu by pressing **Left ALT** while **Holding any directional block** in your hand. You can change the selected orientation by using scroll wheel while the menu is open.

<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.2)">**Note:** I'm aware of Chests, Ender chests and bells not rendering correctly in the orientation picker menu. This is issue of owo-lib (The UI Library this mod is using)</span>
